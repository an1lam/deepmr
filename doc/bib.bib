@ARTICLE{Didelez2007-vs,
  title    = "Mendelian randomization as an instrumental variable approach to
              causal inference",
  author   = "Didelez, Vanessa and Sheehan, Nuala",
  abstract = "In epidemiological research, the causal effect of a modifiable
              phenotype or exposure on a disease is often of public health
              interest. Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect
              are not always possible and inferences based on observational
              data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely
              linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it
              can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself
              associated with any confounding factors - a phenomenon called
              Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental
              variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the
              confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we
              present a formal framework for causal inference based on
              Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs
              to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework
              allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization
              technique that have often been overlooked in the medical
              literature.",

              Gene Regulation",
  author   = "Lai, Xuelei and Verhage, Leonie and Hugouvieux, Veronique and
              Zubieta, Chloe",
  abstract = "Unlike most transcription factors (TF), pioneer TFs have a
              specialized role in binding closed regions of chromatin and
              initiating the subsequent opening of these regions. Thus, pioneer
              TFs are key factors in gene regulation with critical roles in
              developmental transitions, including organ biogenesis, tissue
              development, and cellular differentiation. These developmental
              events involve some major reprogramming of gene expression
              patterns, specifically the opening and closing of distinct
              chromatin regions. Here, we discuss how pioneer TFs are
              identified using biochemical and genome-wide techniques. What is
              known about pioneer TFs from animals and plants is reviewed, with
              a focus on the strategies used by pioneer factors in different
              organisms. Finally, the different molecular mechanisms pioneer
              factors used are discussed, highlighting the roles that tertiary
              and quaternary structures play in nucleosome-compatible
              DNA-binding.",
