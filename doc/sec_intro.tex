\section{Project Criteria \& Ideas}
\subsection{Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We're interested in doing something that illuminates a mechanism behind some sort of biological phenomenon.
    \item We're both interested in recurrent-style NNs (includes Transformers).
    \item Stephen's interested in causality.
    \item Stephen's interested in network learning.
    \item Stephen's interested in model interpretability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Participate in the single cell breast cancer prediction challenge.
    \item \hyperlink{https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/}{Building blocks of interpretability} inspired new interpretability technique that doesn't just look at specific examples.
    \item (Stephen's favorite): Pre-train a Transformer to predict DNA sequences and then aggressively fine-tune it on a task like TF binding prediction.
\end{itemize}
