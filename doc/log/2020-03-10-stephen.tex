Yesterday I had a minor breakthrough in which I figured out part of the cause of our large standard errors. It had to do with discrepancies between \verb!np.var! and \verb!np.cov! -- the former returns the input type, the latter always \verb!float64!s; the former doesn't use Bessel's correction by default, the latter does -- and a misplaced parenthesis. Now that that's resolved, I want to spot check the calibration of the standard errors, but I'm less suspicious of them on priors.

Once I check the standard errors, then I'm actually going to break open the black box and see whether the most impactful mutations result from the disruption of known motifs.
