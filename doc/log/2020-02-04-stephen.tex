\topic{Kipoi Uncertainty Estimates Cont.}
Managed to get mean, variance, and covariance estimates using all the stuff I've been working on this past week. In the process, I made two graphs which seem worth capturing here.

The first depicts predictive variance versus predictive mean with colors representing different sequences (each dot is for a maybe mutated variant of the sequence). As expected, predictive variance increases as predictions become more uncertain (become closer to 0.5).
