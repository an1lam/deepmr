\topic{Past few days}
I forgot to log some of my work over the past few days here but essentially I've just been futzing around with the post-Kipoi data processing a bit and also reading a bunch about MR-Egger regression, which I now mostly understand.

\topic{Today}
Now I'm finally ready to actually run the MR-Egger code in R with NN-generated data.

Spent a lot of time getting all the annoying R stuff setup locally. I think I have stub code that's \textit{this} close to allowing me to run MR-Egger on our predictions. However, before I do that, I need to remember to re-run the prediction code with batch size set to 301 instead of 300 so that there are no extra un-mutated sequences in the batches. I also need to remember to generate new random sequences equally sampled from binding / no binding regions \textbf{for FOXA2} not CTCF.
